# User Story

As a blog browser, I want to be able to view, edit, update & delete blogs on the applicaton.
The home page should be an index of all blogs and should feature buttons that allow the user to create their own blog, edit an already existing blog or delete a blog. Once a new blog is added, the user should be redirected back to the homepage.
